              <br> We are certified on the major platforms and thrive in multi-vendor environments. We look at IT infrastructure from all angles, ensuring the technical opportunities are aligned with the business goals.<br>
              <br> We understand the challenges that the current legacy solutions impose on your ability to innovate and compete, but even there we reveal improvement opportunities.

              <br> Each and every one of these metrics are an indicator of a current state, a pulse.<br>
              <br> By applying analytics systematically over time, we discover patterns that enable you to answer the important questions:<br>
              <br> Does your service provider deliver according to SLA? How are you aligned for future growth? Which part of the daily operations can be optimized?</p>

          <h2>Hybrid Cloud</h2>
          <p>In today's business architectures, a common theme is finding ways to leverage the internet scale offerings from cloud providers while complying with regulations of storing client data locally.
          </p>
          <p>We want the best of both worlds, and the challenge with this model is managing this hybrid cloud as a single entity. Streamlining the application delivery and operational processes.
          </p>
          <p>In these scenarios we build frameworks that ties together the different pieces in your service delivery stack. Using orchestration, one deployment cycle can be scaled up to one hundred, on-demand.</p>

          <h2>Service Compliance</h2>
          <p>Compliance is a key part of any organization handling sensitive data or delivering a highly critical service to the public. Maintaining security and operational compliance is usually a rigorous process requiring multiple departments to follow strict procedures.
          </p>
          <p>We think compliance should be a continuous and transparent part of the daily operations, giving you instant feedback on compliance status. As soon as a change is rolled out, automated processes verify that the infrastructure remains in a compliant state. The same model applies to security and operational stability.</p>

          <h2>Operational Efficiency</h2>
          <p>The daily operations is a mix of technical tasks and business processes. In common, most of them require a high degree of manual and repetitive labor. It can be information retrieval, new deployments, upgrading of existing systems or simple idle waiting for a linear task to complete.
          </p>
          <p>Using telemetry we are able to highlight the outliers in a given process chain. Where are the pain points and how much can be gained by thinking differently. Maybe 30% of it can be fully automated? Let's spend energy on that.</p>
